## Goal

_Display a CRUD apllication

## Methodology

I chose to use a Github to manage my code with a Kanban [here](https://github.com/users/IssaDia/projects/6) to list and manage the different issues in order to complete this project.


## üèó Built with

- [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud)
- [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/)
- [Typescript](https://fr.vuejs.org/v2/guide/typescript.html)
- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) 
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

## My code environment and utils

- VsCode
- MacOs
- NPM
- EsLint
- Prettier
- Postman

## Why this choice?

I chose the stack on par with what the company was suggesting.

## Biggest challenges for this project

- set the Api with Apollo, TypeGraphQl and NextJs

## Feedback

It was a really good challenge. Allowed me to improve my backend skills with GraphQl :

- create an API with Apollo GraphQl
- make API calls

and practice NextJs again :

- create a NextJs project
- use a CSS library (styled components)
- consuming data from api with Apollo Client
